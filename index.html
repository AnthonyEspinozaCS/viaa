            <h2 class="ff-sans-normal fs-600">Geographic Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Our strategic acquisition plan for KeepingCare in Canada, our initial focus will be on British Columbia (BC); characterized by high fragmentation, Canada's home healthcare sector comprises over 4,000 private enterprises, with a
              significant majority being profit-oriented independent entities. Factors contributing to this widespread fragmentation include the relative ease of launching a home healthcare business and the pervasive requirement for such services,
              particularly in rural or isolated locales. Although home care falls outside the purview of the Canada Health Act, classified as an "extended health service," there is considerable variation in how provinces and territories manage their
              publicly funded home healthcare programs. This variation, along with targeted funding for specific disabilities, First Nation citizens, and veterans, accentuates the industry's dispersed nature. As a result, there are notable challenges
              to the efficient integration and effective coordination of care services throughout the healthcare spectrum. To effectively break into this market, KeepingCare must carefully navigate these disparities and adopt a highly localized
              strategy, starting with BC. Despite its inherent challenges, the fragmentation also uncovers opportunities for expansion and consolidation within this crucial healthcare sector.

                    1995, he assumed the role of Regional VP for PepsiCola in Rio de Janeiro. His strong leadership skills later led him to assume the COO role for all Brazil sales and operations. He managed an impressive annual sales volume of $975
                    million (USD) and a workforce of over 3,500 employees. From 1997 to 2000, David served as President of an unprofitable division of PepsiCola Americas. He was entrusted with turning around the division with annual revenues of $275
                    million (USD).<span id="dots-1">..</span>

                      instrumental in driving the inorganic growth of TridentCare. He led numerous company acquisitions, which contributed to TridentCare becoming the largest provider of mobile diagnostic services in the US, operating in 43 states
                      and providing services to over 5,000 of the 16,000+ long-term care facilities and tens of thousands of patients at home.
